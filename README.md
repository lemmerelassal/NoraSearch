# ðŸ§  NoraSearch â€” PostgreSQL Extension

**NoraSearch** is a PostgreSQL C++ extension that performs a *solid search* operation between two text strings.  
It compares all character alignments between a main string and a substring, returning offsets where multiple matching characters occur.

This extension is a C++ port of a Go function originally designed for position-based substring correlation (`solidSearch`), now adapted to PostgreSQL with efficient native performance.
